We can multiply the last two element of the two vectors and then use the pop_back() command to remove the last element, then repeat the above procedural until there is no element left in the vector.
If the numbers of elements in the two vectors are different, we should throw an exception.

or just use the expression:
double Vector<double>::operator*(const Vector<double> &v);
