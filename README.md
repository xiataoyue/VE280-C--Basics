# VE280-C++-Basics

## Introduction

This is the course `VE280` in `JI`, taught by Professor Paul Weng.



In this course, there are several labs and projects for you to practice your programming skills. Although not so hard, I'm a little stupid, so some of them cannot pass all the hidden cases on `JOJ`.



My exam scores are low, so the exam related files are not recommended for reference.
